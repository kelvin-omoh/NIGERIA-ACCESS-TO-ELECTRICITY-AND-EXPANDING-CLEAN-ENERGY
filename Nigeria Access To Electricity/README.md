## Introduction

Access to electricity is a crucial factor for sustainable economic development in Nigeria. It has been a struggle to deliver dependable and inexpensive power to its inhabitants, with about 92 million persons out of the country’s 200 million population lacking access to power and according to the World Bank, the percentage of Nigerians with access to electricity has only increased from 47% in 1990 to 60% in 2018. Nigeria's electricity infrastructure has not matched the population's increasing demand, which is a significant obstacle to the country's progress.

 Nigeria's low electricity access  and underdeveloped grid infrastructure has a significant constraint for citizens and businesses, resulting on annual economic losses estimated at $26.2 billion (₦10.1 trillion) which is equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP.
 
The national grid (generation, transmission, and distribution) of Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC)  is plagued by inefficiencies, poor maintenance, and inadequate investments. The transmission network, in particular, has been a bottleneck, limiting the amount of power that can be transmitted across the country.

Mini-grids are a feasible solution for expanding electricity access in Nigeria. According to the World Bank, Nigeria has a vast potential for mini-grids, with over 60 million people living in areas without access to the national grid. A mini-grid can be powered by various renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro.
<Img src="./Assets/Linear Representation/Grid 4.jpeg">
 The mini-grid operator can sell electricity to households and businesses, providing them with a reliable and affordable power supply.
The feasibility of a mini-grid depends on various factors such as the availability of renewable resources, the size of the community, and the energy demand. A feasibility study is necessary to determine the technical, financial, and social viability of a mini-grid project.


 In Nigeria, mini-grids are becoming increasingly popular as a way to increase access to electricity in areas where the grid has not yet reached or is unreliable.

<Img src="./Assets/Map Models/Grid 2.jpeg"/>
Here are some of the most promising areas for mini-grid development in Nigeria:

1. **Rural communities**: According to the Nigerian Rural Electrification Agency (REA), more than 80% of Nigeria's rural population lacks access to electricity. Mini-grids can provide a reliable and affordable source of power to these communities, which can help to improve their living standards and support economic development.

1. **Agricultural communities**: Agriculture is a major part of Nigeria's economy, and many rural communities are engaged in farming. Mini-grids can provide power for irrigation, which can help farmers to increase crop yields and income. They can also provide power for processing and storage facilities, which can help to reduce post-harvest losses and increase the value of agricultural products.

1. **Urban areas**: Although Nigeria's cities are connected to the main power grid, the supply is often unreliable and subject to frequent blackouts. Mini-grids can provide a reliable and affordable source of power to urban areas, which can help to improve the quality of life for residents and support economic development.

1. **Industrial estates**: Mini-grids can provide reliable and affordable power to industrial estates, which can help to attract new businesses and support economic growth. They can also provide power for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are an important part of Nigeria's economy.

To develop mini-grids in these areas, renewable energy developers and investors need to consider several factors. These include the local demand for electricity, the availability of renewable energy resources, the regulatory environment, and the financial viability of the project.

### Actionable insights for developers and investors include:

1. Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify the most promising areas for mini-grid development. This should include an assessment of local energy demand, the availability of renewable energy resources, and the regulatory environment.

1. Identify potential partners and stakeholders, including local communities, government agencies, and financial institutions. This can help to build support for the project and increase its chances of success.

1. Develop a business model that is financially sustainable and can attract investment. This may involve a combination of revenue streams, including tariffs, grants, and subsidies.

1. Invest in high-quality equipment and technology that is suitable for the local environment. This can help to ensure the reliability and longevity of the mini-grid system.

1. Build strong partnerships with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that the mini-grid system meets their needs and is supported by the community.

To attract investors, the Nigerian government needs to provide a conducive environment for investment by creating policies that encourage investment in the energy sector.
Investors can bring fusion into the Nigerian grid by investing in mini-grid projects, renewable energy development, and grid modernization. Nigeria offers significant opportunities for renewable energy investment, particularly in the solar and wind sectors. Investors can also explore opportunities to develop hybrid mini-grids that combine multiple energy sources and incorporate energy storage systems. The Nigerian government has developed policies and regulations to encourage investment in the energy sector, including tax incentives and tariff guarantees.

Introduction
Nigeria's population has been growing steadily, but the increase in access to electricity has not kept pace with the population growth. Many Nigerians still lack access to reliable electricity, and this has negative impacts on economic development, health, and quality of life. The use of mini-grids and renewable energy is a promising solution to address this challenge. This technical documentation discusses the concept of mini-grids, feasibility, the grid responsible for electricity in Nigeria, and how investors can bring fusion into the Nigerian grid.

Nigeria's Access to Electricity and Mini-Grids
A mini-grid is a localized electricity generation and distribution system that operates independently of the national grid. Mini-grids can provide electricity to small communities or individual buildings that are not connected to the national grid. They can use various energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and diesel. Mini-grids can be a cost-effective solution for providing electricity in remote or under-served areas, including rural areas in Nigeria.

Feasibility of Mini-Grids
Feasibility studies are essential for determining the viability of mini-grids. A feasibility study evaluates the technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects of a mini-grid project. It considers factors such as the energy demand, the availability and suitability of energy sources, the cost of equipment, the operating and maintenance costs, the revenue streams, and the social impacts. The feasibility study helps investors and developers to identify potential challenges, risks, and opportunities associated with mini-grid projects.

Grid Responsible for Electricity in Nigeria
The Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) is responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in Nigeria. NESI comprises of generation companies, transmission company, distribution companies, and the system operator. However, the national grid is often unreliable, and many Nigerians rely on generators or other forms of backup power.

Investor Opportunities in Nigerian Grid
Investors can bring fusion into the Nigerian grid by investing in mini-grid projects, renewable energy development, and grid modernization. Nigeria offers significant opportunities for renewable energy investment, particularly in the solar and wind sectors. Investors can also explore opportunities to develop hybrid mini-grids that combine multiple energy sources and incorporate energy storage systems. The Nigerian government has developed policies and regulations to encourage investment in the energy sector, including tax incentives and tariff guarantees.
